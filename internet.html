                <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
        <p> The internet is a worldwide network that is made up of many protocols. These specific protocols all communicate with eachother to solve different problems.
        Some examples of these problems might be
        having one connection network down and having to resort to a different one to communicate information.Without the internet it would be hard to imagine what our world would look like today, there would be no texting, no sending images at extreme speeds, and overall less identity theft. </p>

<h3>The Creators!</h3>    
It was first created by a whole team but the main two people were Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn they worked to infuse many different protocols within their system, here are some examples:

<h4> Examples</h4>
    Transmission control protocol(TCP)- solves the problem of sending large messages by using accuracy
<br>
    User Datagram protocol(UDP)- Solves problems of sending large messages by speed.
<br> We use these systems everyday but have never sat down and thought about how they worked until now!
