         <h2>What are Packets and how do they work?</h2>
        <p> Packets are large messages that have been split up into smaller segments to transfer data. Packets work by being sent out when a chunk of data such as a message needs to be split up into smaller parts to transfer sucessfully to the right place. Packets contain destination IP addresses which tells them where they need to end up. Once all the packets are sucessfully in the right place they will reform into the larger message/segments once again.</p>
        <br>
        <img src= "packet2.png"> Examples of Packets: Sending a song to the desired device that wants to listen and breaking the song up into smaller packets to deliver it more quickly.

        <h3 style="color:Tomato;">What are Routers and how do they work?</h3>
        <p> Routers are the data recievers and senders for networks  in a computer. They work by recieving packets and determining which path to send the packet down based on its IP address so it can reach its desired destination</p>

        <h4  style="color:white;">What is Redundancy and how does it work?</h4>
        <p> Redundancy is a system within the internet where many pathways for packets to be sent through are up and working.This is to provide internet reliability incase of failure within a system so that all the other systems can keep working as intended</p>
        <img src= "redundancy.jpeg"> Examples of Redundancy: Having backup systems for your network incase one pathway gets interuped or cyber attacked.
