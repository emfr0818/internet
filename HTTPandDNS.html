        <br>
       <h2 style="color:White;">What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and how does it work?</h2> 
        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is a protocol that allows users to publish and communicate data to the world wide web. It works by using GET requests to find files or send data. When GET requests are sent the server will respond with files that will then be shown to the user/requester. These requests are sent all around the internet using IP packets/ TCP packets indicating a files destination.</p>
        <br>
        <img src= "getrequest.png"> Examples of Hypertext Transfer Protocols:Getting the definition of an unknown word. You search up the word on a web browser and GET requests search the web for files telling you what the word means,and in seconds that information is back to you.

        <h3 style="color:DarkRed;">What is the Domain Name System and how does it work?</h3> 
        <p> The Domain Name System or DNS is a system of servers that associates and keeps track of different IP address that go with each website/domain a user wants to visit. Each website a user visits has a Unique IP address,meaning when a user searches up a website the DNS servers associate that name that was typed in the search bar with an IP address and returns the website to the user in the correct location where it was searched up.</p>
        <img src="DNS.png">  Examples of Domain Name Systems: A user searches up code.org in their web browser, within seconds that name will be sent to the DNS server and an IP address will be detected and sent back to the user and the appropriate page of the code.org website will pop up.

        <h4 style="background-color:White;">How often we use these systems and don't realize!</h4>
        <p style="color:White;">Think about everyday when you go on the web and search something up, send messages, do work, etc. We use these systems all the time but never stop to think about how they work... until now!</p>
